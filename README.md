# freeCodeCamp - Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Project

This is my solution for the **Rock–Paper–Scissors AI project** from the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python curriculum.

The goal is to build an AI player that wins **at least 60%** of games against four different bots.  
My solution does this using:
- Frequency analysis
- Pattern prediction (Markov-like)
- Anti-cycle strategy
- Adaptive countering
